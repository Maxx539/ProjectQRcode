# ProjectQRcode
a small site for a social experiment in my school

a small qr code will be hidden somewhere
the qr code will redirect you to a site
there will be a timer
if a device is connected to the site at the end of the timer
  The user will receive a color either red blue or [a], there will only be one [a]
but if not the site will be a blank screen forever

Possible print(in french):

Vous Ãªtes "color".
Votre couleur est un secret.
Vous garderez le secret pendant [t] jours.
A partir de maintenant.
Revenez demain pour plus d'infos.
...
Si quelqu'un vous demande:
|(in repeat)
|Vous ne participez pas.
|Vous ne savez rien.
(blank screen if you reconnect before 24h has passed)

traduction:
you are "color". your color is a secret. you will keep it for [t] days. Starting now. Return tomorrow for more info.
if someone asks you: you are not involved. you know nothing.

#1(25/06) Ideas
every day, you have one irl task, every task is a bit different but the colors will be in competition for [something]
with vague hints you will search other people like "today the opossite color will be very excited for an upcoming event" or something like that
if you spot someone of the opossite side, you can eliminate them by typing their initials just before new informations(1 try only)
(will also eliminate "allies")
(you dont know if you eliminated someone or not) 
  #OBVIOUS PROBLEM: if someone puts random initials it kinda breaks the whole thing
  Solution 1: getting every initials in my school and disregarding those who are not in this list
    #OBVIOUS PROBLEM: duplicates and its very long
  Solution 2: Make a totaly different system
  Solution 3: no elimination

the [a] could be two different things:
  -the lone wolf: he knows he is the only one and he has to compete with the two colors but he also knows their current tasks
  -the underdog: doesn't know he is alone still has to compete against the two colors knows the [something]
  
i will probably change some stuff over time
i will put something for [a] [t] [something] when i clearly know what to put
I will come back as often as i can 

#2(03/07) 
ok [a] will probably be white.
still thinking about [something]
